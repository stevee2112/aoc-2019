For this puzzle i did not fully solve if programmatically.  However I could have doing the following.  (Which is what I did manually to get the answer)

- Determine the relative slope of the center of the tractor beam
- increase the grid size to 100 * 100
- update where we start compile the tractor beam grid based on relative slope and general width expansion of the beam
- move to a coordinate that was far away enough that the results would be totally incased in the grid
- if all grid tiles were affected by the tractor beam we know the 100*100 square would fit
- test some closer coordinates until we know this is the closest value
